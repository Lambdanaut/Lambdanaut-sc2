# Lambdanaut (Starcraft 2 Bot)
This is a StarCraft 2 bot coded using [python-sc2](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2) that has the ability to integrate with the [LadderManager](https://github.com/Cryptyc/Sc2LadderServer) so that it can run against other bots on the [SC2 AI Ladder](http://sc2ai.net).

This bot can be run either locally against a computer opponent, or through the [LadderManager](https://github.com/Cryptyc/Sc2LadderServer). The file "run.py" is used for both variants, which loads Lambdanaut-sc2 from lambdanaut/bot.py, and starts the appropriate game type.

## Requirements
* [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [python-sc2](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2)
